## Pool fall-through

The setting `autonomous.capacity_fallthrough` (default off). When on, a worker
task whose requested capacity pool cannot be granted is admitted on an
alternate backend that has room instead of waiting. Verifiers never fall
through. See [howto/automata-capacity.md](howto/automata-capacity.md#pool-fall-through).

## Allowed fall-through target

An LLM entry setting (`fallthrough_target`, default off). With pool
fall-through on, a marked entry may receive a worker whose requested pool is
full. The other lane fill backend is tried first and needs no mark. See
[howto/automata-capacity.md](howto/automata-capacity.md#pool-fall-through).
