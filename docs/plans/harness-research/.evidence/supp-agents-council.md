## 🏛️ Overview

Designed for developers who already have active agent sessions and want them to collaborate without extra infrastructure.

**Agents Council** is the simplest way to bridge and collaborate across AI Agent sessions like **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Gemini**, **Cursor** or others. It allows your agents to combine their strengths to solve your most difficult tasks without leaving their current context.

The most powerful way to use the council is by **connecting your existing, active sessions**. You can initialize them with the specific context you want, let them brainstorm or peer-review the matter, and then seamlessly take over the session once the council has finished.

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [LLM Council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council), it provides an MCP-based CLI tool that lets multiple agents communicate with each other and find solutions to your most complex tasks.

## ✨ Features

- **Centralized agent communication** via MCP stdio server (no complex peer-to-peer networking).
- **Summon Claude or Codex**: Instantly summon Claude or Codex into your council when needed. Reuses local CLI authentication where available.
- **Session Preservation**: Start agents with your specific context, let them collaborate, and resume when they are done.
- **Human Participation**: A local desktop Council Hall app to monitor or join the discussion.
- **Private & Local**: State is stored on disk at `~/.agents-council/state.json`.
- **Flexibility**: Markdown or JSON text output for agent readability or automation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Agents Council requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).**

### 1. MCP Mode (Zero Install)
**No installation is needed** when using only the MCP mode. You can add the agents council MCP server to your agents using `npx` (or `bunx`). See the [MCP Setup](#-mcp-setup) section below for specific commands.

If you only need agent-to-agent communication, skip to MCP Setup. Install the CLI only for the desktop app and global `council` command.

### 2. Desktop App & CLI
If you want to participate via the desktop app or use the `council` command globally, install the package:

```bash
npm install -g agents-council
```

Then run one of these:

```bash
council        # desktop default launch
council chat   # compatibility alias: also launches desktop
council mcp    # terminal MCP server mode
```

### 3. Distribution Model

Releases keep a single user-facing npm package (`agents-council`) backed by platform optional dependencies:

- `agents-council-linux-x64`
- `agents-council-linux-arm64`
- `agents-council-darwin-x64`
- `agents-council-darwin-arm64`
- `agents-council-windows-x64`

Each platform package ships:

- the `council` CLI binary for terminal mode (`--help`, `--version`, `mcp`), and
- Electrobun desktop artifacts in `desktop-artifacts/` for native installer/update distribution.

GitHub releases publish the Electrobun desktop-launchable artifacts for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## 📖 Quick Start

1. **Start a council session** in one terminal (e.g. via Claude Code) and describe the complex topic you need help with.
2. **Join the council** from another terminal (e.g. via Codex or Gemini) to provide feedback.
3. **Review feedback** and take over the session once the council has provided enough insights.

## 💬 Desktop Council Hall

Run the local desktop interface for human participants:

```bash
council
```

`council chat` remains available as a compatibility alias and opens/focuses the same desktop interface.

The desktop interface follows the Council Hall redesign:

- **Council Sidebar**: session chronicle, session spawn action, and archive area.
- **Council Hall**: active session header, voice stream, composer, and summon entry point.

The summon workflow is part of the Hall interface. Model and agent selections persist in `~/.agents-council/config.json`.

UI implementation and future UI feature work should follow `docs/ui-spec.md` and `docs/ui-implementation-progress.md`.

## 🪄 Summon Agents

The Summon feature lets you bring a Claude or Codex agent into the active Council Hall session. Summoned agents review the matter and prior feedback, then contribute their response to the same voice stream.

### Summon Claude

Prerequisites:

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) must be installed and available in your PATH
- Run `claude` at least once to authenticate

How it works:

1. A summoned Claude agent joins the active council session
2. It reads the current request and any prior feedback
3. It contributes a response using the council tools
4. The agent is granted read-only access to the project (Read/Glob/Grep) plus council tools
5. Other tools follow your Claude Code user permission settings

Advanced Configuration:

These settings are optional. By default, Agents Council looks for `claude` in your PATH.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Claude Code Path** (Settings UI) | `claude` | Custom path to the Claude Code executable |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH` (env var) | `claude` | Alternative way to set the path |
| `AGENTS_COUNCIL_SUMMON_DEBUG` | (unset) | Set to `1` to enable debug logging |

### Summon Codex

Prerequisites:

- Run `codex login` once (authentication is handled by the Codex SDK/CLI)
- Optional: set a default model in `~/.codex/config.toml` (for example, `model = "gpt-5.2-codex"`)

How it works:

1. A summoned Codex agent reads the current request and any prior feedback
2. It returns a single response that is recorded in the council
3. Codex runs via the Codex SDK CLI in read-only mode by default

Advanced Configuration:

Authentication is handled by the Codex SDK/CLI (typically `codex login`). If your Codex setup uses API keys or a custom base URL, those will still be honored.

These settings are optional. By default, Agents Council uses the bundled Codex CLI from the SDK.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Codex CLI Path** (Settings UI) | bundled | Custom path to the Codex CLI executable |
| `CODEX_PATH` (env var) | (unset) | Alternative way to set the path |
