# Changelog

All notable changes to datawatch will be documented here.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Native Go Signal backend (libsignal-ffi)
- Container images and Helm chart
- Test suite

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **MCP 1:1 feature parity** — MCP server now exposes 17 tools (up from 5), covering all major messaging commands:
  - `session_timeline` — structured event timeline (state changes, inputs with source attribution)
  - `rename_session` — set a human-readable session name
  - `stop_all_sessions` — kill all running/waiting sessions
  - `get_alerts` — list alerts, optionally filtered by session
  - `mark_alert_read` — mark alert(s) as read
  - `restart_daemon` — restart the daemon in-place (active sessions preserved)
  - `get_version` — current version + latest available check
  - `list_saved_commands` — view the saved command library
  - `send_saved_command` — send a named command (e.g. `approve`) to a session
  - `schedule_add` / `schedule_list` / `schedule_cancel` — full schedule management
- **Session audit source tracking** — `conversation.md` and `timeline.md` now record the source of each input (e.g. `(via signal)`, `(via web)`, `(via mcp)`, `(via filter)`, `(via schedule)`). All `SendInput` call sites pass origin context.
- **`/api/sessions/timeline` endpoint** — returns the structured timeline events for a session as JSON (`{session_id, lines[]}`).
- **`datawatch session timeline <id>` CLI command** — prints timeline events for a session; tries HTTP API first, falls back to reading `timeline.md` directly.
- **Session detail Timeline panel (Web UI)** — a ⏱ Timeline button in the session header loads and displays the structured timeline inline below the output area; click again to dismiss.
- **Alerts grouped by session (Web UI)** — alerts view now groups alerts under their session (with session name/state and a link to the session detail), instead of a flat list. Sessions in `waiting_input` state are highlighted with a ⚠ indicator.
- **Quick-reply command buttons in alerts (Web UI)** — when a session is in `waiting_input` state, its alert group shows saved commands (approve, reject, etc.) as one-click reply buttons.
- **Alert quick-reply hints in messaging** — when a `waiting_input` alert is broadcast to messaging backends, the message now appends `Quick reply: send <id>: <cmd>  options: approve | reject | ...` when saved commands exist.
- **`Router.SetCmdLibrary()`** — wires the saved command library into the router for alert quick-reply generation.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`datawatch restart` command** — stops the running daemon (SIGTERM) and starts a fresh one; tmux sessions are preserved.
- **`POST /api/restart` endpoint** — web UI and API clients can trigger a daemon in-place restart via `syscall.Exec`; responds immediately, restarts after 500ms.
- **`restart` messaging command** — all backends (Signal, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, etc.) now accept `restart` to restart the daemon remotely.
- **Inline filter editing** — filter list rows now have a ✎ edit button; clicking expands an inline form to change pattern, action, and value. Backend: `PATCH /api/filters` now accepts `pattern`/`action`/`value` fields for full updates (not just enabled toggle).
- **Inline command editing** — command rows now have a ✎ edit button for in-place rename/value change. Backend: new `PUT /api/commands` endpoint accepts `{old_name, name, command}`.
- **Backend section UX redesign** — messaging backends in Settings now show "⚙ Configure" (unconfigured) or "✎ Edit" + "▶ Enable / ⏹ Disable" buttons instead of a misleading ▶/⏸ play-pause toggle. A "Restart now" link appears after any change.
- **`FilterStore.Update()`** — new method to replace pattern/action/value on an existing filter.
- **`CmdLibrary.Update()`** — new method to rename or change the command of an existing entry.

### Fixed
- **Settings page layout** — filter/command/backend rows now use consistent `.settings-list-row` classes with proper 16px left padding; no more content flush against the left edge. Delete buttons styled red for clarity.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Web UI version mismatch** — Makefile ldflags now set both `main.Version` and `github.com/dmz006/datawatch/internal/server.Version` via a shared `LDFLAGS` variable. Previously only `main.Version` was set by ldflags; `server.Version` was hardcoded in source and could drift, causing `/api/health` to return a stale version string.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`/api/update` endpoint** — `POST /api/update` downloads the latest prebuilt binary and restarts the daemon in-place via `syscall.Exec`. Web UI "Update" button now calls this endpoint instead of the check-only command.
- **Self-restart after CLI update** — `datawatch update` calls `syscall.Exec` after successful prebuilt binary install to restart the running daemon in-place.
- **Tmux send button in channel mode** — session detail input bar now shows both a "ch" (MCP channel) and a "tmux" send button when a session is in channel mode, making it easy to send to the terminal directly (e.g. for trust prompts during an active session).
- **opencode-acp: ACP vs tmux interaction table** — `docs/llm-backends.md` now has an explicit table documenting which paths go through ACP vs tmux for opencode-acp sessions.
- **CHANGELOG reconstructed** — v0.5.13 through v0.5.20 entries added (were missing).

### Fixed
- **`channel_enabled` defaults to `true`** — channel server is now self-contained (embedded in binary); enabling by default requires no extra setup.
- **Mobile keyboard popup on session open** — input field auto-focus is skipped on touch devices (`pointer:coarse`), preventing the soft keyboard from opening when navigating to a session.
- **Uninstalled backends selectable** — new session backend dropdown now marks unavailable backends as `disabled`; they show `(not installed)` but cannot be selected.
- **Android Chrome "permission denied"** — notification permission denied toast now includes actionable instructions (lock icon → Site settings → Notifications → Allow).
- **Backlog cleanup** — removed 8 completed items: docs opencode-ACP table, `channel_enabled` default, session auto-focus, uninstalled LLM filter, CHANGELOG missing entries, update+restart, Android notification, send channel/tmux toggle.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`datawatch status` command** — top-level command showing daemon state (PID) and all active sessions in a table. Sessions in `waiting_input` state are highlighted `⚠`. Falls back to local session store if daemon API is unreachable.
- **opencode ACP channel replies** — `message.part.updated` SSE text events from opencode-acp sessions are broadcast as `channel_reply` WebSocket messages; the web UI renders them as amber channel-reply lines, matching claude MCP channel visual treatment.
- **Self-contained MCP channel server** — `channel/dist/index.js` embedded in the binary via `//go:embed`. On startup with `channel_enabled: true`, auto-extracted to `~/.datawatch/channel/channel.js` and registered with `claude mcp add --scope user`. No manual npm/mcp setup required.
- **`/api/channel/ready` endpoint** — channel server calls this after connecting to Claude; datawatch finds the active session's task and forwards it. Replaces broken log-line detection.
- **`apiFetch()` helper in app.js** — centralised fetch with auth header + JSON parse.
- **`make channel-build` target** — rebuild channel TypeScript and sync to embed path.
- **Planning Rules in AGENT.md** — large plans require `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with date, version, scope, phases, and status.

### Fixed
- **Session create: name/task not shown ("no task")** — `submitNewSession()` now uses `POST /api/sessions/start` (REST) and navigates directly to the new session detail via the returned `full_id`, eliminating the 500 ms WS race.
- **Ollama "not active" for remote servers** — `Version()` probes `GET /api/tags` over HTTP when `host` is set, instead of running `ollama --version`. Remote Ollama servers without a local CLI binary now show as available.
- **Web UI version stuck at v0.5.8** — `var Version` in `internal/server/api.go` was not kept in sync with `main.go`; synced to current version.
- **Node.js check for channel mode** — `setupChannelMCP()` verifies `node` ≥18 in PATH before proceeding; emits actionable warning with install instructions and disable hint if missing.
- **Channel task not sent automatically** — removed broken `channelTaskSent` sync.Map output-handler; replaced by `/api/channel/ready` callback from channel server.
- **`/api/channel/ready` route missing** — handler existed in `api.go` but route was not registered in `server.go`.

### Internal
- `session.Manager.SetOnSessionStart` callback.
- `server.HTTPServer.BroadcastChannelReply` forwarding method.
- `opencode.OnChannelReply` package-level callback + `acpFullIDs` pending map.
- `opencode.SetACPFullID()` timing-safe association for ACP full IDs.

## [0.5.20] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`datawatch status` command** — shows daemon PID state and all active sessions; `WAITING INPUT ⚠` highlights sessions needing input.
- **opencode-acp channel replies** — SSE `message.part.updated` events broadcast as `channel_reply` WS messages for amber rendering in web UI.
- **AGENT.md planning rules** — large implementation plans must be saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

### Fixed
- **`internal/server/api.go` version stuck at 0.5.8** — `var Version` was not updated alongside `main.go`; synced.
- **Backlog cleanup**: removed completed items (docs Node.js, agent rules, opencode ACP, status cmd, session name, ollama status, web UI version).

---

## [0.5.19] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Self-contained MCP channel server** — `channel/dist/index.js` embedded in binary via `//go:embed`; auto-extracted and registered on startup with `channel_enabled: true`.
- **`/api/channel/ready` endpoint** — channel server calls this after connecting to Claude; datawatch forwards the session task automatically.

### Fixed
- **Broken log-line detection** — removed `channelTaskSent` sync.Map and ANSI-poisoned log matching; replaced by `/api/channel/ready` callback.
- **`/api/channel/ready` route unregistered** — handler existed but was missing from `server.go` route table.

---

## [0.5.17] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Filter-based prompt detection** — `detect_prompt` filter action marks sessions as `waiting_input` immediately on pattern match, without idle timeout. Seeded by `datawatch seed`.
- **Backend setup hints in web UI** — selecting an uninstalled backend shows setup instructions (links to docs, CLI wizard command).

### Fixed
- Various web UI layout fixes.

---

## [0.5.16] - 2026-03-28

### Internal
- Version bump; no functional changes.

---

## [0.5.15] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **MCP channel server for claude-code** — `channel/index.ts` TypeScript server implementing MCP stdio protocol; enables bidirectional tool-use notifications and reply routing without tmux.
- **Web UI dual-mode sessions** — session cards show `tmux`, `ch` (MCP channel), or `acp` (opencode ACP) mode badge.
- **Ollama setup wizard** — queries available models from the Ollama server (`GET /api/tags`) instead of requiring manual model name entry.
- **Dev channels consent prompt detection** — idle detector recognises `I am using this for local development` pattern and marks session as `waiting_input`.

### Fixed
- Channel flags and MCP server registration for `--dangerously-load-development-channels`.
- Registered Ollama and OpenWebUI backends in the LLM registry.

---

## [0.5.14] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **opencode-acp backend** — starts opencode as an HTTP server (`opencode serve`); communicates via REST + SSE API for richer bidirectional interaction than `-p` flag mode.
- **ACP input routing** — `send <id>: <msg>` routes to opencode via `POST /session/<id>/message` instead of `tmux send-keys`.

---

## [0.5.13] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **tmux interactive sessions** — fixed session launch for backends requiring PTY allocation; added debug logging for tmux session creation.
- **Update binary extraction** — archive contains plain `datawatch` binary (not versioned name); extraction now matches correctly.

---

## [0.5.12] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Session name shown in list**: session cards now display `name` when set, falling back to `task` text. Previously named sessions always showed "(no task)".
- **About section**: added link to `github.com/dmz006/datawatch` project page.

---

## [0.5.11] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **ANSI color stripping** in web UI output — terminal escape sequences are stripped before display so raw color codes no longer appear in the session output panel.
- **Android back button support** — `navigate()` now pushes `history.pushState` entries; the `popstate` event intercepts Android Chrome's back gesture and applies the double-press guard for active sessions.
- **Settings About: version + update check** — About section now fetches version from `/api/health` and provides a "Check now" button that queries the GitHub releases API and shows an "Update" button when a newer release is available.
- **Drag-and-drop session reordering** — session cards now have a ⠿ drag handle; dragging between cards reorders the list (replaces ↑↓ buttons).
- **Numbered-menu prompt patterns** — idle detector now recognises claude-code's folder-trust numbered menu (lines containing "Yes, I trust", "Quick safety check", "Is this a project", "❯ 1.", etc.) as waiting-for-input prompts.

### Fixed
- **Signal not receiving user commands** — when signal-cli is linked to the user's own phone number, messages sent from their phone arrive as `syncMessage.sentMessage` (not `dataMessage`). The receive loop now parses these and dispatches them as commands. This was the root cause of "datawatch can send but cannot receive" on linked-device setups.
- **Shell/custom backend launches claude-code** — `manager.Start()` now looks up the requested backend by name in the llm registry when `opt.Backend` is set, wiring the correct launch function. Previously `backendName` was updated but `launchFn` remained as claude-code.
- **ANSI codes break prompt pattern detection** — `monitorOutput` now calls `StripANSI()` on the last output line before pattern matching, so TUI-style prompts with color codes trigger `waiting_input` correctly.
- **Empty project dir → "Please provide a directory path"** — `handleStartSession` (REST) and `MsgNewSession` (WS) now default `project_dir` to the user's home directory when not supplied.
- **Install script can't find binary in archive** — `install.sh` now searches the extracted archive directory for any file matching `datawatch*` when the exact `datawatch` name isn't present (handles both GoReleaser and manually packaged archives).
- **Task description required** — removed the 400-error check on empty task in `handleStartSession`; empty task starts an interactive session.
- **`moveSession` ↑↓ buttons removed** — replaced by drag-and-drop (old buttons caused layout issues and were redundant).

---

## [0.5.10] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Session resume documentation** added to `docs/llm-backends.md` for claude-code (`--resume`) and opencode (`-s`).
- **`root_path` and `update` config blocks** documented in `docs/operations.md` and `README.md`.

### Fixed
- **`datawatch update` now uses prebuilt binaries** instead of `go install`. Downloads the platform-specific archive from GitHub releases (with progress output), falls back to `go install` if the prebuilt download fails.
- **Directory browser navigation**: replaced inline `onclick` attributes with event delegation on `data-path` attributes, fixing navigation failures caused by special characters in path strings.
- **Task description is now optional** in the New Session form. Shell sessions and interactive backends can be started without a task.
- **`BACKLOG.md`** updated with new bugs (optional task description, dir browser navigation). Removed four previously resolved bugs.

---

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Delete button** in session detail view for finished sessions (complete / failed / killed). Prompts for confirmation, then calls `POST /api/sessions/delete` with `delete_data: true` to remove the session and all tracking data. Navigates back to the sessions list on success.
- **Saved commands quick-send panel** in session detail view for active and waiting sessions. Fetches `GET /api/commands` and renders clickable buttons above the input bar so saved commands can be dispatched in one click without typing.
- **Update progress output**: `installPrebuiltBinary` now prints download progress (percentage and KB at every 10% increment when `Content-Length` is known, or every 512 KB otherwise), plus extract and install step markers, so long updates give visible feedback.

### Changed
- **`AGENT.md`**: added "BACKLOG.md Discipline" rule — completed bugs/backlog items must be removed from `BACKLOG.md` after implementation; partially fixed items should be updated in place.

### Fixed
- **`BACKLOG.md`**: removed four resolved bugs (Signal already-linked detection, session delete UI, remote servers local default, needs-input alert + saved commands quick-send + SendInput accepting running state). Updated remaining bug to note partial status.

---

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Session history toggle**: sessions list hides stopped sessions by default; "Show history (N)" toolbar button reveals them. Active sessions are always shown.
- **Double-back-press guard**: pressing Back from an active session requires a second press within 2.5 s; a toast warning appears on the first press to prevent accidental navigation.
- **Saved sessions clickable link**: the "X saved sessions" count on the Settings page is now a clickable link that navigates to the sessions list filtered to history (completed/failed/killed).
- **Saved commands management in web UI**: Settings page now has a collapsible "Add Command" form (name + command + description fields) posting to `POST /api/commands`. Existing commands have a Delete button.
- **Output filters management in web UI**: Settings page has a collapsible "Add Filter" form (pattern + action + description) posting to `POST /api/filters`. Existing filters have a Delete button.
- **Directory browser navigation**: file browser in New Session form now has separate navigate-into and select actions. Clicking a folder navigates into it; a "✓ Use This Folder" button selects the current directory. `..` entry navigates up.
- **`session.root_path` config field**: restricts the file browser to a subtree — users cannot navigate above this path. At the root boundary, `..` is hidden and the path is clamped silently.
- **Session resume**: New Session form has an optional "Resume session ID" field. When set, claude-code launches with `--resume <ID>` and opencode with `-s <ID>`. Restart button pre-fills the resume ID from `sess.llm_session_id`.
- **Auto-update daemon**: new `update` config section with `enabled`, `schedule` (hourly/daily/weekly), and `time_of_day` (HH:MM). On schedule, downloads a prebuilt binary from GitHub releases and hot-swaps the running executable.
- **Backend availability in `/api/backends`**: each entry now includes `available` (bool) and `version` string. Web UI shows "(not installed)" for unavailable backends and a warning div when an unavailable backend is selected.

### Fixed
- **Bug: Signal already-linked detection** (`runLink`): detects existing `accounts.json` and `data/<number>/` directory; prints removal instructions instead of overwriting a working setup.
- **Bug: Session delete endpoint** (`DELETE /api/sessions/delete`): `Manager.Delete()` added; kills active session, removes from store, optionally removes tracking directory on disk.
- **Bug: Remote servers "local" default**: local server row now shows as active/connected when `state.activeServer === null`.
- **Bug: needs-input alert**: `NeedsInputHandler` now calls `alertStore.Add` so a Level-Info alert fires whenever a session enters waiting-for-input state.
- **Bug: `SendInput` accepts `running` state**: previously rejected sessions not in `waiting_input`; now also accepts `running`. State transition back to `running` only occurs if session was `waiting_input`.

---

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Stop button** in session detail view for active sessions (running / waiting_input / rate_limited). Sends a kill request and updates state immediately.
- **Restart button** in session detail view for finished sessions (complete / failed / killed). Pre-fills the New Session form with the original task, backend, and project directory.
- **Session backlog panel** in the New Session view: lists the last 20 completed/failed/killed sessions with one-click Restart to resume any prior task.
- **`POST /api/sessions/kill`** REST endpoint — previously session termination was only accessible via the command parser; now has a dedicated authenticated endpoint.
- **Symlink support in file browser**: `GET /api/files` now follows symlinks to directories so symlinked project folders appear as navigable directories (shown with 🔗 icon).

### Fixed
- **`make install`** now passes `-ldflags "-X main.Version=..."` so the installed binary reports the correct version string instead of the default `0.5.x`.

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **install.sh**: `--version X.Y.Z` argument parsing was broken (`${!@}` syntax error under `set -euo pipefail`), causing the script to exit immediately with no output. Replaced with a portable `while` loop over a bash array.

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Windows cross-compile**: moved `daemonize()` to `daemon_unix.go` (`//go:build !windows`) and `daemon_windows.go` so the Windows binary builds without the Unix-only `syscall.SysProcAttr.Setsid` field. Pre-built Windows/amd64 binary now included in releases.

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`datawatch diagnose [signal|telegram|discord|slack|all]`**: connectivity diagnostic command for all messaging backends. Signal diagnose lists all known groups and validates the configured `group_id`; Telegram, Discord, Slack check live API connectivity. `--send-test` flag sends a test message to verify outbound delivery.
- **`datawatch diagnose --send-test`**: sends a test message to the configured group/channel to verify end-to-end delivery.
- **Signal backend stderr capture**: signal-cli's stderr is now always piped and logged (`[signal-cli stderr] ...`). Java startup errors, auth failures, and exceptions are now visible in daemon.log.
- **Signal backend verbose logging**: `datawatch start -v` now logs every raw JSON-RPC line sent/received from signal-cli, and full pretty-printed notifications for debugging.
- **Signal 4MB scanner buffer**: increased from 64KB default to 4MB to handle large group messages without silent truncation.
- **Signal self-filter fix**: normalises both sides of the number comparison with `strings.TrimPrefix("+")` to avoid format mismatch false-positives/negatives; uses `EffectiveSource()` (preferring `sourceNumber` in signal-cli v0.11+ responses).
- **Signal `EffectiveSource()`**: `Envelope.EffectiveSource()` returns `sourceNumber` (populated in signal-cli v0.11+) if set, falling back to `source`.
- **Signal scanner error logging**: `readLoop` now logs scanner errors explicitly instead of silently exiting.
- **Installer `--version X.Y.Z`**: install script now accepts `--version X.Y.Z` to install a specific release instead of the latest.

### Changed
- **Signal notification dispatch**: non-data envelopes (receipts, typing, sync) are logged in verbose mode and silently skipped; previously they caused confusing empty-message drops.
- **AGENT.md**: added "Supported Commands / Notification Events" requirement to the "New messaging/communication interface" rule; added interactive input, filter, and saved command documentation requirements to the "New LLM backend" rule.
- **`docs/messaging-backends.md`**: added "Command Support by Backend" comparison table; added "Supported Commands" section to Signal, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, and Twilio; added "Notification Events" table to ntfy and Email.
- **`docs/llm-backends.md`**: added "Command and Filter Support" section covering saved commands, output filters, and interactive input support by backend.

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **AGENT.md**: Added "Functional Change Checklist" under Release Discipline — after any functional change, bump version, run `make release-snapshot` to verify build, verify `datawatch update --check` reports the new version, and confirm install script downloads the prebuilt binary. Documents that `datawatch update --check` (CLI) and `update check` (messaging) are the canonical ways to check for available upgrades.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **install.sh**: prebuilt binary is now tried first; Go source build is only used as a fallback when the release archive download fails. Previously, if Go was installed on the host, the installer skipped the prebuilt download entirely and built from source (downloading Go if it wasn't new enough), which was slow and unnecessary.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **install.sh**: version is now resolved dynamically from the GitHub releases API at install time (was hardcoded as `"0.1.0"`); falls back to `"0.5.0"` if the API is unreachable.
- **install.sh**: Go fallback installer no longer fails with `mv: cannot overwrite` when the Go versioned directory already exists (`~/.local/go-X.Y.Z` is removed and re-extracted cleanly).
- **install.sh**: prebuilt binary download now uses GoReleaser archive format (`datawatch_VERSION_linux_ARCH.tar.gz`) instead of the old bare-binary URL that was never published.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`alerts` messaging command**: send `alerts [n]` to any messaging backend to view recent alert history; alerts are also broadcast proactively to all active messaging backends when they fire.
- **`setup llm <backend>`**: CLI and messaging-channel setup wizards for all LLM backends — `claude-code`, `aider`, `goose`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `ollama`, `openwebui`, `shell`.
- **`setup session`**: wizard to configure session defaults (LLM backend, max sessions, idle timeout, tail lines, project dir, skip permissions).
- **`setup mcp`**: wizard to configure the MCP server (enable, SSE, host, port, TLS, token).
- **`datawatch test [--pr]`**: collects non-sensitive interface status (endpoints, binary paths, model names) for all enabled interfaces and optionally opens a GitHub PR updating `docs/testing-tracker.md`.
- **GoReleaser integration**: `.goreleaser.yaml` added; `make release` creates GitHub releases with pre-built binaries for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64.
- **AGENT.md rules**: added rules for new communication interfaces (testing tracker, data flow docs, config field documentation, security options), and for release discipline (GoReleaser, PR check before commit/release).
- **DNS channel design**: expanded `docs/covert-channels.md` with command subset, query format specification, Mermaid sequence diagram, config block, security model, and threat model table.
- **`docs/testing-tracker.md`**: expanded with LLM backend rows, Web/API section, validation checklists per interface type, and DNS channel row.

### Changed
- `BACKLOG.md`: removed implemented `#future` items (LLM setup wizards, alerts command). Remaining backlog: DNS channel implementation.
- `Makefile`: updated VERSION to 0.5.0; added `release` and `release-snapshot` targets; added `windows/amd64` to `cross` target.

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Upgrade guide** in `docs/operations.md` (new section 2): covers `datawatch update`, in-place upgrade procedure, data compatibility across versions, encrypted store stability, and rollback.
- **`docs/covert-channels.md`**: research notes on DNS tunneling, ICMP, NTP, HTTPS, and steganographic channels for constrained network environments.

### Changed
- `docs/operations.md`: section numbering shifted by one (new section 2 = Upgrading; former sections 2–8 are now 3–9).
- `BACKLOG.md`: removed completed `#today` and `#next` sections; retained `#future` and `#backlog`.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`--secure` now encrypts all data stores**: sessions.json, schedule.json, commands.json, filters.json, alerts.json are all encrypted with AES-256-GCM when `--secure` is set. A 32-byte symmetric key is derived once at startup via Argon2id and a persistent salt at `~/.datawatch/enc.salt`. Per-write operations use a fresh nonce with no KDF overhead.
- **`internal/secfile` package**: `Encrypt`/`Decrypt`/`ReadFile`/`WriteFile` helpers for AES-256-GCM store encryption without re-running the KDF. All stores have `*Encrypted` constructor variants.
- **`config.DeriveKey` + `config.LoadOrGenerateSalt`**: key derivation and salt persistence for the data encryption layer.
- **Command library** (`internal/session/cmdlib.go`): named reusable command strings backed by `~/.datawatch/commands.json`
- **`datawatch cmd add/list/delete`**: CLI commands for managing the command library
- **`datawatch seed`**: pre-populates the command library and filter store with useful defaults for common AI session interactions
- **Session output filters** (`internal/session/filter.go`): regex-based rules that fire `send_input`, `alert`, or `schedule` actions when output lines match
- **`FilterStore` + `FilterEngine`**: persistent filter store; engine processes each output line against enabled filters via `onOutput` callback on session Manager
- **`Manager.SetOutputHandler`**: new callback on the session manager, called for each output line; used by the filter engine
- **System alert channel** (`internal/alerts/store.go`): persistent alert store at `~/.datawatch/alerts.json`; listener pattern for WebSocket broadcast on new alerts
- **`GET /api/commands`**, **`POST /api/commands`**, **`DELETE /api/commands`**: REST endpoints for command library management
- **`GET /api/filters`**, **`POST /api/filters`**, **`PATCH /api/filters`**, **`DELETE /api/filters`**: REST endpoints for filter management
- **`GET /api/alerts`**, **`POST /api/alerts`** (mark read): REST endpoints for alert history
- **`MsgAlert` WebSocket type**: server pushes new alerts to all connected Web UI clients in real time
- **Alerts view in Web UI**: dedicated Alerts nav tab with unread badge counter; shows full alert history; marks all as read on open
- **Saved Commands section in Web UI Settings**: lists saved commands, allows deletion
- **Output Filters section in Web UI Settings**: lists filters with enable/disable toggle and deletion
- **Scheduler NeedsInputHandler bug fix**: `runScheduler` previously overwrote the combined NeedsInputHandler set in `runStart`. Fixed by extracting `fireInputSchedules` as a standalone helper called from the combined handler instead.

### Changed
- `--secure` mode previously only encrypted `config.yaml`; now all data stores are encrypted when the flag is set
- `session.NewManager` accepts an optional `encKey []byte` variadic parameter for encrypted session store
- `ScheduleStore`, `CmdLibrary`, `FilterStore`, `alerts.Store` all expose `*Encrypted` constructors
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`datawatch update [--check]`**: check for and install updates via `go install` from GitHub releases
- **`datawatch setup server`**: CLI wizard to add/edit remote datawatch server connections with connectivity test
- **`--server <name>` global flag**: target any CLI command at a configured remote server
- **`datawatch session schedule` subcommands**: `add`, `list`, `cancel` for scheduling commands to sessions
- **Schedule daemon goroutine**: fires time-based scheduled commands every 10s; on-input commands fire when sessions enter `waiting_input` state
- **`version` messaging command**: reply with current daemon version
- **`update check` messaging command**: reply with version + update availability
- **`schedule <id>: <when> <cmd>` messaging command**: schedule a command from any messaging backend
- **`GET /api/servers`**: list configured remote servers (tokens masked)
- **`GET/POST/DELETE /api/schedule`**: REST endpoints for schedule management
- **`GET|POST /api/proxy/{serverName}/{path}`**: proxy endpoint for Web UI to reach remote servers
- **Remote Server setup wizard** over all messaging channels (`setup server`)
- **Session ordering in Web UI**: up/down buttons on session cards; order persisted in localStorage
- **Remote server selector in Web UI Settings**: lists configured servers with reachability status; click to select active server
- **`RemoteServerConfig` + `Servers []RemoteServerConfig`** config fields
- **`internal/session/ScheduleStore`**: persistent schedule store at `~/.datawatch/schedule.json`
- **MCP daemon compatibility note** in `docs/mcp.md`

### Changed
- Router `handleSetup` now lists `server` as an available service
- `newRouter` helper in `runStart` wires schedule store, version, and update checker into every router
- Version bumped to 0.3.0 (new features, non-breaking additions)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Daemon mode**: `datawatch start` now daemonizes by default (PID file at `~/.datawatch/daemon.pid`, logs to `~/.datawatch/daemon.log`). Use `--foreground` to run in terminal.
- **`datawatch stop` command**: sends SIGTERM to the running daemon; `--sessions` flag also kills all active AI sessions.
- **`datawatch setup <service>` command**: interactive CLI wizards for all 11 backends (signal, telegram, discord, slack, matrix, twilio, ntfy, email, webhook, github, web). Telegram/Discord/Slack/Matrix wizards auto-discover channels/rooms via API.
- **Setup wizards over messaging channels**: `setup <service>` command available via every messaging backend (Signal, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, etc.) — stateful multi-turn conversation engine in `internal/wizard/`.
- **Config encryption**: `--secure` flag enables AES-256-GCM config file encryption with Argon2id key derivation. Use with `datawatch --secure config init` and `datawatch --secure start --foreground`.
- **`GET/PUT /api/config` REST endpoint**: read and patch backend enable/disable status and server settings. Sensitive fields (tokens, passwords) are masked in GET responses.
- **Web UI backend status**: Settings view now shows enable/disable status for all backends with toggle buttons (calls `/api/config`).
- **Quick-input buttons in Web UI**: when a session is waiting for input, y/n/Enter/Ctrl-C buttons appear above the text input for one-click responses.
- **Web server setup wizard** (`setup web`): enable/disable the web UI and configure host/port/bearer token/TLS from CLI or any messaging backend.
- `server.tls_enabled` and `server.tls_auto_generate` config fields for TLS configuration.
- `docs/testing-tracker.md`: interface validation status tracker for all 14 backends.
- `internal/wizard/` package: `Manager`, `Session`, `Step`, `Def` types for cross-channel stateful wizards.

### Changed
- `datawatch start` now defaults to daemon mode. Existing `--foreground` flag keeps the old behavior.
- `datawatch config init` wizard is now service-agnostic (Signal section is optional).
- "No backends enabled" error message now points at `datawatch setup <service>`.
- `datawatch link` auto-creates the config file if it does not exist.
- `router.NewRouter()` signature updated to accept an optional `*wizard.Manager`.
- `server.New()` signature updated to accept `fullCfg` and `cfgPath` for `/api/config`.
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 (new features, non-breaking additions).

### Dependencies
- `golang.org/x/crypto` promoted from indirect to direct (Argon2id for config encryption)
- `golang.org/x/term` promoted from indirect to direct (password prompts for `--secure`)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Session naming: set a human-readable name at creation (`--name` flag or PWA) and rename at any time (`session rename`, `/api/sessions/rename`)
- Per-session LLM backend override: `--backend` flag on `session new`, backend selector in PWA
- `session stop-all` CLI command: kill all running sessions on this host
- `backend list` CLI command: list registered LLM backends with active marker
- `completion` CLI command: shell completion for bash, zsh, fish, powershell
- New REST endpoints: `/api/backends`, `/api/files`, `/api/sessions/start`, `/api/sessions/rename`
- Directory browser in PWA: navigate the filesystem to select a project directory when starting a session
- `skip_permissions` config field: pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to claude-code
- `kill_sessions_on_exit` config field: kill all active sessions when the daemon exits
- `--llm-backend`, `--host`, `--port`, `--no-server`, `--no-mcp` flags on `datawatch start`
- ANSI escape code stripping from session log output sent via messaging backends
- `NO_COLOR=1` set when launching claude-code to reduce color noise
- Extended claude-code permission dialog patterns for `waiting_input` detection
- Debug logging for Signal group ID mismatches to aid troubleshooting
- Session list now shows `NAME/TASK` and `BACKEND` columns
- AGENT.md versioning rule: every push requires a patch version bump
- AGENT.md docs rule: every commit must include documentation updates

### Changed
- `session new` now uses `/api/sessions/start` REST endpoint when daemon is running
- Config `show` subcommand displays all sections including messaging and LLM backends
